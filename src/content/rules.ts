	text4_1:
		'TLDR: Solve problems completely correctly to earn points, but only a participant’s most recent submission will be graded. Extra points are awarded for early submissions and fast code. Participants get entries equal to how many points they earn. Have fun! :)',

	text4_2:
		'Every participant will receive some number of points for every problem.',
	text4_3:
		'Participants who do not make a submission to a problem will receive a score of zero (0) points for that problem.',
	text4_4:
		'Participants who make one (1) submission to a problem will have that submission evaluated for points.',
	text4_5:
		'Participants who make more than one submission to a problem will have their most recent submission over the entire problem evaluated for points.',
	text4_6:
		'Note that this is not necessarily the submission for which the participant would get the most points!',

	text4_7: 'A participant receives points for a submission as follows:',
	text4_8:
		'If the submitted program produces the correct output for every test case within the given time and memory constraints, the participant receives the maximum possible number of points corresponding to the subproblem.',
	text4_9:
		'Unless otherwise indicated in the problem, all code is run with a time limit of 2.000 seconds and a memory limit of 256 megabytes.',
	text4_10:
		'If the program does not produce the correct output for every test case within the given time and memory constraints, the participant receives zero (0) points.',

		'If extenuating circumstances arise, the contest organizers reserve the right to manually adjust the score of any submission.',

	text4_12:
		'Six (6) bonus points are awarded to participants who satisfy both the following criteria:',
	text4_13:
		'Received a non-zero number of points on each of the three problems that week; AND',
	text4_14:
		'Did not make any submissions after 11:59:59 PM EDT on Wednesday of the corresponding challenge week.',

	text4_15:
		'All problems have a bonus time complexity. If a participant’s solution is correct AND has a better time complexity than the bonus time complexity, they will receive an additional three (3) points for that problem. These three (3) points can be earned alongside the six (6) points from rule #3.',
	text4_16:
		'If you are interested in learning about time complexities and earning these bonus points, please consult the Appendix for specifics.',

	text4_17:
		'It is guaranteed that full points can be achieved on all problems using Python. Reference solutions that achieve full points will be released after each contest week and for every problem.',
	text4_18:
		'At the end of each week, participants will receive a number of entries corresponding to the total number of points they received that week. Each point is equivalent to one (1) entry.',
